## Git Commit Message Generator
It will be possible that the program gives the user the recommended message for the current commit as a hint by inspecting changed program codes.


## SSH-based BBS(Forum) Engine
Everything converges on web service but some people still like to do his job in a terminal. BBS service over Telnet seems to be a sort of lost technology nowadays, so I want to make it with my hand.


## Library as an RSS
Thesis database like IEEE Xplore, RISS has an API to search for a specific paper.  
It would be nice if there's RSS service which shows a recent set of theses filtered with my area of interest or keywords.  


## Tiny hardware VST
Even though VST is mainly used in Windows, there are wrappers to run it on Linux. How about making a palm-sized hardware instrument/effect based on VST? If it makes sense, a MIDI keyboard also can be used outside!


## Keyword Extractor
Estimate the main keywords from the document and recommend them.


## Prime Number Predictor
Can prime numbers be predicted?  
Can distinct functions be made with learning lots of them?
